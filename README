Introduction
============
Okay so it's a somewhat stupid name, but what can you do I only have some many hours in the day to come up with names. 

Q. What is it?
A. It is an event display and plotting program for use with ANITA-II data in ROOT format. (In theory it could be used with ANITA-I data but it would need a quote a few mods to deal with the change in antenna number etc.

Q. Why should I use it?
A. That's a very good question, maybe you shouldn't. I find it is a useful way to look at the rootified data. I know there a people who don't like the rootified data and that's fine an updated AnitaViewer will do everything this does and a whole lot more.

Q. So what's the point?
A. My preferred way to look at the data is using the ROOT trees rather than the binary files. I find it easier to implement calibrations and unpacking in one place rather than everyone having to do it themselves. This provides people, well right now me, with a (hopefully) really simple way to look at the ROOT data files.

Q. How do I get it?
A. Read on, you can also visit the website at:

Prerequisites
=============
There are, unfortunately, several pre requisites for installing and running Magic Display.
i) ROOT -- If you don't have it installed get the latest version from http://root.cern.ch
ii) FFTW3 -- The Fastest Fourier Transform in the west. If you don't have libfftw3.so on your machine then you need to install it. Most linux distributions have a package ready to install, otherwise head to http://www.fftw.org/
iii) libRootFftwWrapper -- A wrapper that makes i) and ii) play nicely together. You can get it from our very own SVN repository. You'll either want R1.2 or the development version. So
    svn co https://delos.mps.ohio-state.edu/anitaGround/libRootFftwWrapper/branches/R1.2 myLRFWDirWithWhateverNameIWant
or 
   svn co https://delos.mps.ohio-state.edu/anitaGround/libRootFftwWrapper/trunk myLRFWDirWithWhateverNameIWant
then see the README file for how to install and compile
iv) eventReaderRoot -- The ANITA event reader program. You can get it from our lovely SVN repository. You'll want either the development version or version 4.0 So:
    svn co https://delos.mps.ohio-state.edu/anitaGround/eventReaderRoot/branches/anitaII/R4.0 myEventReaderDirWithWhateverNameIWant
or 
    svn co https://delos.mps.ohio-state.edu/anitaGround/eventReaderRoot/trunk myEventReaderDirWithWhateverNameIWant


Downloading
===========
The recommended way to download the program is from the svn repository. Try doing:
   svn co https://delos.mps.ohio-state.edu/anitaGround/magicDisplay/trunk (or branches/R0.1)  mySillyNamedMagicDisplayDir
Alternatively tar files of the releases can be obtained from:
http://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/uhen/anita/magicDisplay

Installing
===========
Four steps to installation happiness:
i) Make sure the prerequisites are installed and accessible from your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
ii) Make SURE ANITA_UTIL_INSTALL_DIR is set and that the eventReader and libRootFftwWrapper files are installed there. (You probably want $ANITA_UTIL_INSTALL_DIR/lib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
iii) type: make
iv) type: make install

Running
=======
i) Get some ANITA II data -- there's a tar file for testing on the website
http://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/uhen/anita/magicDisplay
ii) Edit macros/runMagicDisplay.C to point to your data and run number
iii) Type:
root macros/runMagicDisplay.C
